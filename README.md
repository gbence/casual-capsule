## 📋 Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 24+ and Docker Compose v2
- Access to Claude or Codex.

## 🚀 Initial setup

There is no true quick start for the first run. Capsule persists GitHub auth
state in the home volume, so it is worth doing setup in this order: prepare the
token first, then start Capsule, then verify the workspace and `gh` auth before
opening Claude or Codex. These checkpoints make later troubleshooting much
easier.

| Phase | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| Prepare credentials | The first Capsule run can persist working GitHub auth. |
| Start Capsule | The image builds and the container starts successfully. |
| Verify the container | The workspace mount and persistent home volume work. |
| Verify GitHub auth | `gh` is already logged in before agent startup. |
| Verify your agent | Claude or Codex can read the workspace. |

### Phase 1: Prepare credentials

1.  Decide if you want to use Claude, Codex, or both.

2.  Generate a GitHub access token.

    1.  Open <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens>.

    2.  Make sure that you are logged in.

    3.  Click on the "Generate new token" button.

    4.  Confirm access if the UI asks you to do so.

    5.  Fill in the "New fine-grained personal access token" form:

        *   Token name: Choose any name. For example, "Capsule".

        *   Fill in the other fields as you see fit. It's ok to leave them on
            the default values.

    6.  Click on the "Generate token" button below the form.

    7.  Click on the "Generate token" button in the popup window.

    8.  Copy the token and save it somewhere safe.

    9.  You may close the GitHub website.

    The token only needs to cover `gh` and repository access. Capsule uses
    it for `gh` auth and as a build secret when `mise` downloads tools from
    GitHub. Claude and Codex authenticate separately, in Phases 5 and 6.

3.  Create a project directory that we can use as a test.

    ```
    $ mkdir /home/myuser/myproject
    $ cd /home/myuser/myproject
    $ echo "My favorite color is purple." > AGENTS.md
    $ echo "My favorite color is purple." > CLAUDE.md
    ```

4.  Create an alias:

    ```
    alias capsule="/absolute/path/to/casual-capsule/capsule.sh"
    ```

    You might want to add this to your init script (such as `~/.bashrc` or
    `~/.zshrc`).

5.  Set `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` to the value you received from GitHub (replace
    `[GITHUB_API_TOKEN]`).

    Set this before the first build/run so the persistent home volume starts
    with working GitHub auth.

    ```
    $ export GITHUB_API_TOKEN=[GITHUB_API_TOKEN]
    ```

### Phase 2: Start Capsule

1.  Build the Capsule Docker image and start it in the current directory.

    ```
    $ capsule --build
    ```

2.  When Capsule asks the following, type "y".

    ```
    Allow capsule to run in /home/myuser/myproject (y/N)?
    ```

3.  You should see that Docker builds the Capsule image, creates a container and
    starts it:

    ```
    $ capsule --build
    Allow capsule to run in /home/myuser/myproject (y/N)? y
    [...]
    [+] build 1/1
     ✔ Image hcs-capsule:local Built
     ✔ Volume casual-capsule_home Created
    Container casual-capsule-cli-run-4d7e2776d2fd Creating
    Container casual-capsule-cli-run-4d7e2776d2fd Created
    user@capsule:/home/workspace$
    ```

    **Checkpoint:** the base image built and Capsule started successfully.

### Phase 3: Verify the container

1.  Check your workspace:

    ```
    user@capsule:/home/workspace$ cat AGENTS.md
    My favorite color is purple.
    user@capsule:/home/workspace$ cat CLAUDE.md
    My favorite color is purple.
    ```

    Your `/home/myuser/myproject` directory is mounted to `/home/workspace`
    inside the container.

    **Checkpoint:** the workspace bind mount is correct before you start an
    agent.

2.  Check the user home directory:

    ```
    user@capsule:/home/workspace$ cat /home/user/.config/gh/hosts.yml
    github.com:
        users:
            myuser:
                oauth_token: [GITHUB_API_TOKEN]
        oauth_token: [GITHUB_API_TOKEN]
        user: myuser
    ```

    The Docker daemon created a `casual-capsule_home` Docker volume when it
    started the container. This volume is mounted to `/home/user`. This volume
    is persistent and shared between Capsule instances. Use `-p` or
    `--private-home` to bind-mount `~/.capsule-home` instead.

    The `/home/user/.config/gh/hosts.yml` file should contain your GitHub API
    token.

    **Checkpoint:** the persistent home volume contains the expected GitHub
    auth configuration.

### Phase 4: Verify GitHub auth

1.  Check that you are logged in to GitHub.

    ```
    user@capsule:/home/workspace$ gh auth status
    github.com
      ✓ Logged in to github.com account myuser (/home/user/.config/gh/hosts.yml)
      - Active account: true
      - Git operations protocol: https
      - Token: [GITHUB_API_TOKEN]
    ```

    **Checkpoint:** `gh` is ready before you open Claude or Codex.

    If `gh auth status` says that you are not logged in, add your GitHub token
    to `github_api_token.txt` (inside the container) and log in manually:

    ```
    $ gh auth login --with-token < github_api_token.txt
    ```

    You can do the same when your token expires in the future.

### Phase 5: Verify Claude (optional)

1.  Start Claude Code:

    ```
    $ claude
    ```

2.  Claude asks if you trust the files in `/home/workspace`.

    Choose the response that proceeds in this folder.

3.  Log in when Claude prompts you to.

    Claude prints a URL to open in your browser. Open it on the host,
    complete the login, and paste the resulting code back into the
    container.

    Credentials are written to `/home/user`, so the persistent home volume
    keeps you logged in across Capsule sessions.

4.  Test the connection and that Claude can read `CLAUDE.md`:

    ```
    > What is my favorite color?
    ● Your favorite color is purple.
    ```

### Phase 6: Verify Codex (optional)

1.  Start Codex:

    ```
    $ codex
    ```

2.  Select "Sign in with Device Code."

3.  Follow the instructions to log in.

4.  Codex asks if you trust `/home/workspace`.

    Choose the following response: "Yes, continue".

5.  Codex probably prints the following warning:

    ```
    Codex could not find bubblewrap on PATH. Install bubblewrap with your OS
    package manager. See the sandbox prerequisites:
    https://developers.openai.com/codex/concepts/sandboxing#prerequisites.
    Codex will use the vendored bubblewrap in the meantime.
    ```

    You can continue this setup, but later you might want to fix this warning.
    There are at least two ways:

    *   One way to eliminate this warning is to run `codex` with
        `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`. This disables the sandbox
        which would use `bubblewrap`.

    *   Another way to eliminate the warning is to use a custom `compose.yml`
        file that adds `privileged: True` to the `cli` service, and use a
        custom `Dockerfile` that installs the `bubblewrap` package with `apt`.
        See more information about this kind of customization in the *Custom
        Capsule images* section.

6.  Test the connection and that Codex can read `AGENTS.md`:

    ```
    › What is my favorite color?
    • Your favorite color is purple.
    ```

## 💡 Usage

Once you set up Capsule, you can start it in any project directory. You can even
start Claude or Codex directly:

```
$ cd /home/myuser/myproject
$ capsule claude
$ capsule codex
```

## ⌨️ Capsule command examples

Pass a command instead of the default shell:

```bash
capsule claude
capsule bash -lc "node -v && python --version"
capsule docker ps
```

Build the image before starting:

```bash
capsule --build
capsule -b claude
```

Build only the custom image before starting:

```bash
CAPSULE_CUSTOM_COMPOSE=/home/myuser/python-capsule/compose.yml \
  capsule --build-custom
```

Use `--` when arguments overlap launcher flags:

```bash
capsule -- --build true
```

## 🧩 Additional features

### UID and GID detection

Capsule auto-detects the host user's UID/GID via `id -u`/`id -g` and
`DOCKER_GID` from the active Docker socket (falling back to `991` on macOS,
`999` on Linux). If UID/GID detection fails (e.g. `id` is unavailable), it falls
back to `1000:100` and prints a warning. The entrypoint handles UID/GID
adjustment and Docker socket group membership at startup.

This mechanism ensures that the user inside the container can access the
`/home/workspace` directory and the host's Docker daemon.

You can override UID/GID or DOCKER_GID by using environment variables:

```bash
CAPSULE_UID=2000 CAPSULE_GID=2000 capsule
```

Bake a custom UID/GID into the image (avoids runtime `chown`):

```bash
CAPSULE_UID=2000 CAPSULE_GID=2000 capsule --build
```

### Directory approval list


On the first run in a new directory, `capsule.sh` prompts for explicit approval
and records the approved path in `~/.config/capsule` (overridable via
`CAPSULE_CONFIG`).

When `--remote` is active, Capsule checks only the remote target in that same
allowlist. Remote targets approved via `--remote` are stored as
`ssh://HOST[:PORT]/path`.

### Private home bind mount

Use `-p` or `--private-home` to replace the shared Docker volume for
`/home/user` with a bind mount from `~/.capsule-home` on the Docker daemon
host.

```bash
capsule --private-home
capsule -p --build
capsule -p -r buildbox:/srv/casual-capsule
```

This keeps Capsule state per user instead of per Docker Compose project.
When `--remote` is active, Capsule resolves `~/.capsule-home` on the remote
host. When `CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP` is active inside a non-Capsule container,
Capsule resolves `~/.capsule-home` through that map; if the map does not cover
`$HOME`, set `CAPSULE_HOME_HOST_DIR` explicitly.

### Custom Capsule images

If you want to extend the Docker image or Compose configuration provided by
Capsule, you can do that by creating a custom `compose.yml` file and setting its
path in `CAPSULE_CUSTOM_COMPOSE`.

The custom `compose.yml` file must override the `cli` section.

Example layout:

```text
/home/myuser/python-capsule/
|- Dockerfile
`- compose.yml
```

Example `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM casual-capsule-cli:latest

RUN uv tool install black
```

Example `compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  cli:
    image: python-capsule:local
    build:
      context: ${CAPSULE_CUSTOM_DIR}
      dockerfile: ${CAPSULE_CUSTOM_DIR}/Dockerfile
    environment:
      PYTHON_CAPSULE: "1"
```

Use it like this:

```bash
export CAPSULE_CUSTOM_COMPOSE=/home/myuser/python-capsule/compose.yml
./capsule --build
```

With a custom compose file, `capsule.sh --build` first rebuilds the base image
`casual-capsule-cli:latest`, then builds the merged custom `cli` image, and
finally starts the container from that merged configuration.

If you only want to rebuild the merged custom `cli` image, use
`capsule.sh --build-custom` instead. This flag requires
`CAPSULE_CUSTOM_COMPOSE`.

### Updating your GitHub token

The entrypoint reads the `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` secret on every container
start and calls `gh auth login --with-token` automatically.  To rotate
your token:

1. Export the new token in your shell:

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_API_TOKEN=ghp_...
   ```

2. Start a new Capsule session — the entrypoint handles the rest:

   ```bash
   capsule
   ```

The updated credentials are written to the persistent home volume and
survive subsequent restarts.  No rebuild is required.

### Graphify knowledge graphs

The image includes
[Graphify](https://github.com/Graphify-Labs/graphify), a local
knowledge-graph CLI and agent skill. On container start, Capsule refreshes
Graphify's vendor skill for Claude, Codex, and Antigravity in the persistent
home volume. Set `CAPSULE_SKIP_SKILL_SYNC=1` to skip this step.

Use `$graphify .` in Codex or `/graphify .` in Claude and Antigravity. The CLI
is also available directly. For a local, code-only graph that needs no LLM
credentials, run:

```bash
capsule bash -lc "graphify extract . --code-only"
```

Generated data is stored under `graphify-out/`, which Capsule git-ignores.
Project-specific exclusions belong in `.graphifyignore` using gitignore
syntax.

Every `capsule --build` checks PyPI for the latest stable Graphify release and
passes that exact version into the image build. If the lookup fails, the
Dockerfile's pinned default is used. Because the resolved version is a build
argument, Docker reuses the Graphify layer until the version changes.

Set `GRAPHIFY_VERSION` to use a specific release or to make an offline build
fully reproducible:

```bash
GRAPHIFY_VERSION=0.9.55 capsule --build
```

A direct `docker compose build cli` uses the Dockerfile default unless the
same environment variable is set. After changing the Graphify version, the
next container start automatically refreshes its installed agent skills.

### Port publishing

Use `--publish` to expose a port from the Capsule container on the Docker
daemon host.

```bash
capsule --publish 8080:8080
capsule --publish 8080:8080 --publish 127.0.0.1:9229:9229
```

Use `CAPSULE_PUBLISH` for repeatable port mappings in environment-based
launchers. Separate mappings with semicolons.

```bash
CAPSULE_PUBLISH="8080:8080;127.0.0.1:9229:9229" capsule
```

### Runtime volume mounts

Use `--volume` or `-v` to add extra bind mounts to the Capsule container.

```bash
capsule --volume /host/cache:/cache
capsule -v /host/data:/data -v /host/cache:/cache
```

Use `CAPSULE_VOLUME` for repeatable mounts in environment-based launchers.
Separate mount specs with semicolons.

```bash
CAPSULE_VOLUME="/host/data:/data;/host/cache:/cache" capsule
```

### Bind mounts in containers started in a Capsule

When `capsule.sh` runs inside an existing container, the path it sees may not
be a path the Docker daemon can mount. Capsule translates the current container
path back to the daemon-host path before asking Docker to create the
`/home/workspace` bind mount.

Inside a Capsule, do not reset `CAPSULE_HOST_WORKDIR`. The outer Capsule sets
it to the daemon-host workspace root, and nested launches reuse it
automatically. Use `CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP` only when the current non-Capsule
container sees the same files under a different absolute path.

```bash
CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP=/workspace=/home/myuser/myproject capsule
CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP=/workspace=/src/project:/tmp/cache=/var/cache capsule
```

`CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP` is a colon-separated list of
`container_prefix=host_prefix` pairs. The first matching prefix wins.

### Remote Docker host

Use `--remote HOST[:PORT]:/abs/path` to build and run on a remote Docker daemon
over SSH. Capsule sets `DOCKER_HOST=ssh://HOST[:PORT]` for Compose and mounts
`/abs/path` as `/home/workspace` on the remote daemon host.

```bash
capsule --remote buildbox:/srv/casual-capsule
capsule --remote buildbox:2222:/srv/casual-capsule
capsule --remote buildbox:/srv/casual-capsule --build
```

The remote target must be approved first. Use an SSH config host alias when you
need extra SSH options beyond the optional port in `HOST[:PORT]`.

## 🔧 Configuration reference

### Command line options

Usage:

```
capsule.sh [OPTIONS]
capsule.sh [OPTIONS] -- [ARGS]
```

Options:

*   `-b`, `--build`: Run `docker compose build cli` before `run`.

*   `-p`, `--private-home`: Bind-mount `~/.capsule-home` from the Docker daemon
    host to `/home/user` in the container.

*   `--build-custom`: Run `docker compose build cli` only for the merged custom
    compose configuration before `run`. Requires `CAPSULE_CUSTOM_COMPOSE`.

*   `-r HOST[:PORT]:/abs/path`, `--remote HOST[:PORT]:/abs/path`: Run
    `docker compose` against `ssh://HOST[:PORT]` and
    mount `/abs/path` as `/home/workspace` on that remote host.

*   `--publish HOST[:CONTAINER]`: Publish a container port on the host when
    running the container. May be passed multiple times.

*   `-v HOST:CONTAINER`, `--volume HOST:CONTAINER`: Bind-mount a host path into
    the runtime container. May be passed multiple times.

*   `--no-cache`: Pass `--no-cache` to the build commands triggered by
    `--build` or `--build-custom`.

*   `-h`, `--help`: Show usage message.

*   `--`: Stop launcher option parsing; pass remaining arguments to
    `docker compose run cli`.

### Environment variables

*   `CAPSULE_DEBUG`: Enable shell xtrace for `capsule.sh`.

    Default: empty. When set to `1`, `capsule.sh` runs with `set -x`.

*   `CAPSULE_UID`: Container user UID (user ID).

    Default: The output of `id -u` on the host. If that doesn't work, then 1000.

*   `CAPSULE_GID`: Container user GID (group ID).

    Default: The output of `id -g` on the host. If that doesn't work, then 100.

*   `DOCKER_GID`: Docker socket GID.

    Default: Auto-detected from the host.

*   `DOCKER_HOST`: Docker daemon endpoint for `docker compose`.

    Default: Docker CLI default. `--remote` sets `ssh://HOST[:PORT]`.

*   `CAPSULE_HOME_HOST_DIR`: Host path bound to `/home/user` when
    `--private-home` is active.

    Default: empty. `--private-home` resolves it to `~/.capsule-home` on the
    Docker daemon host, using `CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP` when needed.

*   `CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP`: Colon-separated
    `container_prefix=host_prefix` mappings for resolving daemon-host paths
    from inside non-Capsule containers.

    Default: empty. The first matching prefix wins, and the mapped host path is
    used for allowlist checks.

*   `CAPSULE_PUBLISH`: Semicolon-separated list of `--publish` specs.

    Default: empty. Each non-empty entry is passed before command-line
    `--publish` options.

*   `CAPSULE_VOLUME`: Semicolon-separated list of `--volume` specs.

    Default: empty. Each non-empty entry is passed before command-line
    `--volume` options.

*   `CAPSULE_WORKDIR`: Workspace directory.

    Default: current working directory.

*   `CAPSULE_CUSTOM_COMPOSE`: Optional custom compose override file.

    Default: empty.

*   `CAPSULE_SKIP_SKILL_SYNC`: Skip Graphify's agent-skill refresh.

    Default: empty. Set to `1` to skip the refresh.

*   `CAPSULE_CONFIG`: Path to the file that contains the approved directories.

    Default: `~/.config/capsule`.

*   `CAPSULE_HOST_WORKDIR`: daemon-host-visible path for `/home/workspace`.

    Default: derived from `CAPSULE_WORKDIR`. `--remote` overrides it with the
    remote workspace path.

*   `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`: Passed as a build secret for `gh` auth and for `mise`
    tool downloads from GitHub.

*   `GRAPHIFY_VERSION`: Override the Graphify package version used by builds.

    Default: latest stable release for `capsule --build`; otherwise the
    version pinned in the Dockerfile.

## 🧪 Run checks and tests

Run lint checks on the host:

```bash
$ tests/check_all.sh
```

Run the test suites on the host:

```bash
$ tests/test_all.sh
```

Run checks and tests inside a Capsule:

```bash
$ capsule tests/check_all.sh
$ capsule tests/test_all.sh
```

`check_all.sh` runs `dclint`, `hadolint`, and `shellcheck` on discovered files.
When one of these tools is missing, it prints a warning and skips that linter.

`test_all.sh` prints each suite name before running it.

*   The fast suite uses command stubs, so it does not require a running Docker
    daemon.

*   The end-to-end suite builds and runs the real capsule image when Docker and
    Compose are available. It skips cleanly when the daemon is unavailable.

    The end-to-end suite also prints the path to a per-run logfile under
    `_build/tests/`. The logfile is kept after the run and records suite events
    and plain Docker/Capsule output with UTC timestamps on every line.

## 🤖 Included agent tooling

The image includes utilities commonly used by coding agents, installed via
`mise` (configured by the `MISE_SYSTEM_TOOLS` Dockerfile ARG). Set
`MISE_SYSTEM_TOOLS` in the build environment to override the default tool list
when building through Compose:

```bash
MISE_SYSTEM_TOOLS="bat fd jq ripgrep uv" docker compose build cli
```

- `claude`: Claude Code agent CLI.
- `codex`: Codex agent CLI.
- `bat`: Syntax-highlighted file viewing.
- `eza`: Enhanced directory listing.
- `fd`: Fast file discovery.
- `gh`: GitHub CLI operations.
- `jq`: JSON filtering and inspection.
- `rg` (`ripgrep`): Fast content search.
- `uv`: Python version, tool, and environment management.

Installed via `apt`:

- `shellcheck`: Shell script linting.
- `tree`: Directory structure visualization.

Python tooling (installed via `uv`; binaries available on `PATH` via
`~/.local/bin`):

- `python`: Python runtime (version set by `PYTHON_VERSION` ARG, default
  `3.14`).
- `ruff`: Fast Python linter and formatter.
- `ty`: Python type checker.
- `graphify`: Local knowledge-graph CLI and agent skill (version set by the
  `GRAPHIFY_VERSION` build argument).

Verify inside capsule:

```bash
capsule bash -lc "rg --version && fd --version && jq --version && \
  bat --version && eza --version && shellcheck --version && \
  gh --version && tree --version && graphify --version && \
  python --version"
```

## 🔐 Security Note

This setup mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` into the container, giving it
host-level Docker access. Do not use with untrusted code or shared hosts.
